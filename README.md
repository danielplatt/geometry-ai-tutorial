# Geometry and AI

Geometry is a discipline in pure maths.
Geometry and AI have two connections:
"-->":
geometry is used to invent machine learning algorithms, such as graph neural networks.
"<--":
machine learning is used to answer questions in geometry, for example by using physics-informed neural networks as a PDE solver.

The structure of the tutorial is:
(1) an introduction to Riemannian geometry,
(2) positive definite kernels on metric spaces as example of the type "-->",
(3) a physics-informed neural network on the circle as an example of the type "<--".

This repository contains the materials for this tutorial.
The tutorial is taught on 5 May 2025 at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Cape Town, South Africa.
